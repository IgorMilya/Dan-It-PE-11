## How to run the app
### Description:
This task was implemented via Node.js, so, if u wanna run the app, u should write the command: `node main.js`

Also this task was done in WebStorm IDE, moreover, I would like to add that u should have node.js on your computer to run the app, as, if u write `node main.js` this command won't work because your computer doesn't have node.js environmental

Furthermore, this task was accomplished via modules system.
